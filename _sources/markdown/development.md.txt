# Architecture

ALOC follows the MVC architecture, meaning that all frontend and backend code are completely seperated from each other. Messages are sent between the back and front end through a controller class. ALOC's source code as a whole is split up into three main directories reflecting this: `model`, `view` and `controller`.

# Testing

To test ALOC we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/). To run the test suite run the following from the source directory:

```bash
$ pytest test
```

Whenever you add a new feature, make sure to write some unit tests for it :).


# Code Style

Code is formatted usin [black](https://github.com/psf/black), please do the same. Also, make sure to document your code - this codebase uses [google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for class and method documentation. Using this will allow you to easily add autogenerated docs using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
